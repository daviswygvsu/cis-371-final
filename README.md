# CIS 371 Final Project ("Xanathar's Vault of Adventures")
Final project for CIS 371, Grand Valley State University's course on Web Application Programming.

## Project Description

This application is a web application designed to make it easier for GMs of table-top RPGs to run their own, homebrewed games.

More specifically, this app should provide interfaces for a campaign's GM to:
* Create their own game; which includes a world, quests, player characters, and non-player characters
* Manage their characters (both player and non-player)
* Manage the quests within their games

As well as allow users to act as GMs for their own games, they can also:
* Create a player character and join a game
* Manage their characters' inventories, levels, etc.

## Stack Overview
This is a single-page web application. It uses:
* HTML as our mark-up language
* CSS for our style sheets
* JavaScript as our scripting language
* React.js as our front-end framework
* Express.js and Node.js make up our back-end framwork
* SQLite as our database
